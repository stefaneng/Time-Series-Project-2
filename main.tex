\section*{Problem 1}

We computed the log returns $X_t = \log(P_t) - \log(P_{t - 1})$.
Using Matlab's Ljung-Box test \textit{lbqtest} with a lag $h = 20$, we got a p-value of 0.1331.
We fail to reject the null hypothesis at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level and conclude that the data in consistent with being $iid$.
In Figure \ref{fig:acf_log_rtns} we plot the autocorrelation function for the log returns.

\section*{Problem 2}

We split the data into a training set with the first 1000 values and a test set with the remaining data (251 values).
We fit a GARCH(p,q) model with Gaussian errors for each $p = 1, \ldots, 10$ and $q = 1, \ldots, 10$, resulting in 100 different models.
For each of these models we computed the BIC (Bayesian information criteria) and plotted the result in the heatmap shown in Figure \ref{fig:bic_heatmap_norm}.
The minimum model was the GARCH(1,1) model
\begin{align*}
X_t &= \sigma_t Z_t && Z_t \sim IIDN(0, 1)\\
\sigma_t^2 &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{t - 1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t - 1}^2
\end{align*}

\end{figure}

\section*{Problem 3}

Using the GARCH(1,1) model, we plotted the residuals (Figure \ref{fig:residual_plots_norm}), QQ plot of the residuals versus standard normal, autocorrelation of residuals, and the autocorrelation of the squared residuals.
The residuals were computed by infering $\hat{\sigma_t}^2$, then dividing the training data by the square root of the infered values, $\hat{\sigma}$.
We would expect these values,
$$
\frac{X_t}{\hat{\sigma}} = Z_t \sim IID(0,1)
$$
Thus, the distribution of the residuals should the residuals should follow a standard normal distribution.
We see that in the QQ plot there is some deviation from the standard normal.
We have heavier tails than we would expect with a standard normal.
The autocorrelation of the sample ACF has almost all of the values within $\pm 1.96 / \sqrt{n}$.
Similarly, the residuals squared also appear to be iid normal as all of the acf values are within $\pm 1.96 / \sqrt{n}$.
Based on the QQ-plot, it makes sense to investigate whether a Student's t distribution, which allows for heavier tails, would fit the data better.

\end{figure}

\section*{Problem 4}

Now we have the model

\begin{align*}
X_t &= \sigma_t Z_t && Z_t \sim IID-t(0, 1)\\
\sigma_t^2 &= \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 X_{t - 1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t - 1}^2
\end{align*}

Where $IID-t(0,1)$ is indepedent and identically distributed Student's t distribution with some degrees of freedom $\nu$.
Again we find that the GARCH(1,1) model has the minimum BIC.
The ACF of the residuals and square residuals are consistent with iid noise as in the previous problem.
A big difference is the QQ plot which now fits almost exactly.
The model was estimated with degrees of freedom equal to 8.03.
